1. Do we want to run prettier against .html, .ts, .scss, .css file?
2. Do we want to run prettier against JSON file?
3. Do we want to run prettier in all other files directory (inclulding root) for all the other files. e.g. sh, gulp file etc.


4. Do we want to run prettier with lint in git hook? Or just prettier?
   If we want lint as well, I will add "nx affected:lint" into the hook.


Demo:
-----------
Major different in SCSS prettier:
&:before, &:after {
  background-color: red;
}
becomes:
&::before,
&::after {
  background-color: red;
}

Major different in
trailingComma for objects, arrays, functions

Intellij plugin for prettier.

Normal reformat according to prettier on the current file is:
Alt-Shift-Cmd-P on macOS or Alt-Shift-Ctrl-P on Windows

Intellij watcher: Intellij >> Settings >> Tools >> File Watchers >> + >> Prettier
>> Add all the files types (Javascript, TypeScript, Cascading Style Sheet, SCSS Style Sheet, HTML) one by one | Choose Any (a bit risky to choose Any)
>> Then Go back for a unformatted file (e.g. a html file), as soon as you make a change, file watcher will auto reformatted.
