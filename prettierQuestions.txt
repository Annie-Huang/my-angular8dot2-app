1. Do we want to run prettier against .html, .ts, .scss, .css file?
2. Do we want to run prettier against JSON file?
3. Do we want to run prettier in all other files directory (inclulding root) for all the other files. e.g. sh, gulp file etc.


4. Do we want to run prettier with lint in git hook? Or just prettier?
